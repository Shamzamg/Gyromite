# Gyromite

Gyromite is a 1985 Nintendo game.

I tried to recreate this old game with Java, the Swing library, and Maven using MVC.

This is a university project, starting in March 5 and has to be done for April 9.

## Librairies

Librairies should be automatically downloaded by Maven.


## .jar File

The runnable .jar file is the one called Gyromite-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies

You can generate it by using Maven:

1.clean

2.install

The file can then be found in the target folder.

## How to play

You control the professor Hector moving with arrow keys.

You can move blue columns downwards or upwards by pressing A. Same for orange ones but with B key. 

You can crush Smicks and also be crushed. 

You need to collect all the dynamites under the given time and you will automatically be teleported to the next level once it is done. 

A collision with a Smick kills you.
